pthread_cond_signal is a function in C pthreads library that is used to signal one waiting thread that is blocked on a condition variable.

The pthread_cond_signal function unblocks one thread that is blocked on the specified condition variable. If no threads are waiting on the condition variable, then the signal is ignored.

Here's the syntax of pthread_cond_signal function:

int pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond);

Here's a brief description of the parameters:

cond: A pointer to a condition variable object.
The pthread_cond_signal function is typically used in conjunction with pthread_cond_wait to synchronize threads on a shared resource. When a thread signals a condition variable using pthread_cond_signal, it indicates that the resource is available and that another thread waiting on the condition variable should try to acquire it.

Note that pthread_cond_signal only unblocks one waiting thread. If multiple threads are waiting on the condition variable, pthread_cond_broadcast should be used instead to unblock all waiting threads.
